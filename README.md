   To start the program, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have cloned the repository. 
   Then, run the following command:

   When you first run the program, you will be prompted to create a new account. 
   You will need to provide your name, your face, a hand gesture, a password, and an optional pin. 
   These will be used for your secure login credentials.

   Once you have created your account, you can log from the main menu with face and optional hand gesture. 
   You will be prompted to enter your password and, if you have set up a pin, your pin as well.

   Once you have successfully logged in, you can encrypt and decrypt files and folders using the "Encryption" and "Decryption" options from the main menu.
